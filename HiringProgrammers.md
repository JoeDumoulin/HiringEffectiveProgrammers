##Screening process (how do we properly vet)
* Pre-Interview
	* **Assessing the role.**  What role will this person play in the team? in the organization?  What is my relationship to that role?
	*  **Assessing the need.** Why are we hiring this person?  Immediate needs, Project needs, Organization needs.
	*  Understand the need and role well enough to assess quickly whether someone is **not** a good candidate.
	*  Describe the roles and the needs of the position from both the organization's perspective and from your perspective.

* Resumes
	* Best practices
	* Who is not a candidate
	* The human resources function and the Human Resources Department
	* What's left?  Are they available?
	* No resume:  recommendations, references, personal experience

* The Interview
	*   Assessing technical skills
		*   Whiteboard tests
		*   Non-Googleable challenges
		*   Language specific tests
		*   Specific problem solving approach tests
			* Creating user stories
			* Designing a process to satisfy a user story.
			* How does the applicant respond to change requests in the design?
		*   General problem solving approach tests

	* Assessing team fitness
		* Is the person engaged?  
		* Is the person interested in problem solving?  
		* Is the person interested in learning?  
		* Is the person interested in the work of others? 
		* Do they ask thoughtful questions?  
		* Does the interviewee evaluate the interviewers? 
		* This is where the 'role evaluation' from above comes in.
	* Intern assessment approach
		* Do we have resources to support the intern?
